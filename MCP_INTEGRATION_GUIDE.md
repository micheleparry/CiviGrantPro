# MCP Integration Guide for CiviGrantPro

## What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standardized way for AI models to interact with external tools and data sources in real-time. It enables AI to access live information, perform actions, and provide contextually relevant responses based on current data rather than just training data.

## How MCP Enhances CiviGrantPro

### Current Limitations vs. MCP-Enhanced Capabilities

#### **Before MCP (Current State)**
- Static AI responses based on training data
- No real-time access to current grant opportunities
- Limited to historical knowledge
- Manual data gathering and analysis
- No live validation of requirements

#### **With MCP Integration**
- Real-time access to live data sources
- Dynamic grant opportunity discovery
- Current policy and trend analysis
- Automated requirement validation
- Live competitor analysis
- Intelligent document processing

## MCP Architecture in CiviGrantPro

### 1. **Core MCP Service** (`server/services/mcpService.ts`)

The MCP service acts as the central hub that:
- Defines available tools and their capabilities
- Manages tool execution and data flow
- Provides context-aware AI responses
- Handles real-time data integration

```typescript
interface MCPTool {
  name: string;
  description: string;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  execute: (params: any) => Promise<any>;
}
```

## How MCP Works in Practice

### 1. **User Query Processing**

When a user asks a question like "What are the latest grant opportunities for education programs?", MCP:

1. **Analyzes the query** to understand intent and required tools
2. **Selects appropriate tools** (e.g., `search_grants_gov`, `search_funding_trends`)
3. **Executes tools** with relevant parameters
4. **Gathers real-time data** from multiple sources
5. **Synthesizes information** into a comprehensive response
6. **Provides context** about data sources and confidence levels

### 2. **Real-Time Data Flow**

```
User Query → MCP Service → Tool Selection → Data Sources → AI Synthesis → Response
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓           ↓
"What are    "Use search_    "Query Grants.   "Live API     "Combine     "Here are
latest       gov tool"       gov, filter      calls, web    data with    the 15
education    for education   by education     searches,     context"     current
grants?"     focus"          category"        news APIs"                  opportunities..."
```

### 3. **Context-Aware Responses**
